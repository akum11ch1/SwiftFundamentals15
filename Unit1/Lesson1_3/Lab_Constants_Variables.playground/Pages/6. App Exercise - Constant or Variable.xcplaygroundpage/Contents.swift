## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
var name = "LaShae"
print("The reason I think that the user's name should be a variable is because it is possible, although rare, that people change their names so it shouldnt be a constant.")
var age = 18
print("I believe age is a variable because in a fitness app, depending on the period of time you have it, your age can change and be different from year to year.")
var stepsTaken = 2000
print("Steps Taken is definitely a variable because the amount can change every minute and/or hour.")
var goalSteps = 10000
print("Goal number of steps is also a variable because you may have a goal to take 5000 steps one week or day, and then change it or double it the next day or week.")
var avgHeartRate = 40
print("In my opinion, average heart rate from the last 24 hours can change because your your average will be higher if your heart rates have been higher, just as they will be lower if the values majorly become lower. ")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
